change a cell -> UPDATE
delete a record (row) -> DELETE
delete a part of table (structure)-> DROP (table, database, event, function, index, server etc.)
delete all records -> TRUNCATE

EXAMPLES:

DELETE FROM orders WHERE id = 1

TRUNCATE TABLE orders

DELETE FROM orders ORDER BY id DESC LIMIT 10

DROP DATA DATABASE books

DROP TABLE users

DROP TABLE IF EXISTS users
